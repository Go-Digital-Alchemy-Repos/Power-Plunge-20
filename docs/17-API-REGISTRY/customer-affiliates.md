## Multi-Router Exports

This file exports two routers:
- `default` — Customer affiliate portal (dashboard, registration, payouts, Stripe Connect), mounted at `/api/customer` with `isAuthenticated`
- `publicAffiliateRoutes` — Public affiliate agreement text, mounted at `/api` with no auth

## Notes

Customer-facing affiliate portal for viewing commissions, requesting payouts, managing Stripe Connect onboarding, and updating affiliate details.
Helper function `getDefaultAffiliateAgreement()` was relocated here from legacy routes.ts during extraction.
