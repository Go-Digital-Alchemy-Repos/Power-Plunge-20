## Module Info

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Domain | admin-shipping |
| Source Files | server/src/routes/admin/shipping.routes.ts |

## Multi-Router Exports

This file exports three routers:
- `default` — Zones and rates CRUD, mounted at `/api/admin/shipping` with `requireFullAccess`
- `shipmentRoutes` — Per-order shipment creation/listing, mounted at `/api/admin/orders` with `requireAdmin`
- `shipmentManagementRoutes` — Shipment status updates and email, mounted at `/api/admin/shipments` with `requireAdmin`

## Notes

Shipping zone/rate configuration plus shipment tracking and notification management.
Shipment routes use `requireAdmin` (not `requireFullAccess`) so fulfillment role can manage shipments.
